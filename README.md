# Docfox

A dead-simple documentation generator for small C libraries, single-file scripts or small projects. While docfox offers (*will offer*) a sleak and sexy template for displaying and browsing the generated documentation, the core documentation is generated as a simple JSON string, thus can be hooked up to almost any for of output.

## Development status
Docfox is currently a work in progress. You might not want to use it until the first alpha release, unless you really want to tinker around with things.

Pull Requests and suggestions are always welcome.
